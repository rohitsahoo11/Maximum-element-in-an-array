# Maximum-element-in-an-array
# DSA Question 2
In this we have to find the maximum element from an array 
So, first we will define the first element of the array as max ( max = arr[0]) 
then iterate through the array, and then compare the elements from the array with the max (if(arr[i]>max))
then assign that element as max (max = arr[i]).
